PART 1: THE PLAN

ZPM International has given you a directive to build out a modern, enterprise security architecture.

Some things you'd like to consider in your design:

Standards Based - using both compliance standards and the cloud provider's guidance. No re-inventing the wheel for security best pratctices wherever possible.

Scalable Architecture - use the cloud provider's guidance in developing an architecture that can grow without having to re-think the 'foundational steps' every time.
