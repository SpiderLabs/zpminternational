# PART 1: THE EXECUTION

Now that an architecture has been approved by your CISO, it's time to start implementing actual security solutions.

The objectives for this stage will be as follows:

- **Use your cloud vendor's security solutions where possible** - For example, if using Azure, you will need to use an E5 license and whatever additional security services are available from that vendor.
- **Follow any guideance from your cloud vendors Well Architected Framework** - as stated in PART 1, use any guidance available from your cloud vendors architecture documentation.
