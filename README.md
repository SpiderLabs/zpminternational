## Lab Backstory: "ZPM International: Architecting Security Defenses Against APT 42a"

ZPM International is a manufacturer of SMR (Small Modular Reactor) related components.

It has recently experienced a large influx of capital due to the popularity of green energy and government committments to eliminating carbon based emissions.

The CISO (Sam O'Neil) understands the sensitivity on the public perceptions over nuclear power and wants to be sure his team doesn't contribute to any negative press that could affect their stock value.

As such Sam has acquired a substantial budget for upgrading the company's security posture.

Sam's objectives are to plan, build, and execute an enterprise scale security infrastructure that can protect ZPM Intl. from a broad range of threats.
