# Lab Backstory: 
# "ZPM International: Architecting Security Defenses Against APT 42a"

ZPM International is a leading manufacturer of components for **Small Modular Reactors (SMRs)**, contributing significantly to the advancement of green energy solutions. The company has recently experienced a substantial influx of capital, driven by the growing popularity of renewable energy and government commitments to eliminating carbon-based emissions.

The **Chief Information Security Officer (CISO)**, *Sam O'Neil*, is acutely aware of the public's sensitivity regarding nuclear power. He understands that any negative press could severely impact the company's reputation and stock value. Determined to prevent any security incidents that could lead to unwanted attention, Sam has secured a substantial budget to enhance the company's security posture.

Sam's objectives are clear: to plan, build, and execute an enterprise-scale security infrastructure capable of protecting ZPM International from a broad spectrum of threats.

However, not everyone is cheering for ZPM's success. A rival company, eager to steal their secrets and undermine their market advantage, has hired a notorious hacker group known as **APT 42a**. Led by the infamous hacker with the call sign **"D0m1nus"**, APT 42a is plotting to infiltrate ZPM's systems and compromise their valuable intellectual property.
