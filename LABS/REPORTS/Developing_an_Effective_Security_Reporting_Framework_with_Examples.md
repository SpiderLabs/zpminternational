Create a reporting framework for your organization.
Here are some topics which may be relevant for your framework:
1. Access Control (AC)
Management of access to resources based on organizational policies and the principles of least privilege and separation of duties.
2. Awareness and Training (AT)
Programs to ensure that personnel are aware of the security risks associated with their activities and the applicable policies, standards, and procedures related to the security of the system.
3. Audit and Accountability (AU)
Mechanisms to record and examine activity within information systems and to hold individuals accountable for their actions.
4. Security Assessment and Authorization (CA)
Processes for assessing security controls in federal systems, authorizing their operation, and continuous monitoring.
5. Configuration Management (CM)
Management and control of configurations for information systems to enable security and facilitate integrity.
6. Contingency Planning (CP)
Preparation for, response to, and recovery from system disruptions to ensure availability and integrity.
7. Identification and Authentication (IA)
Ensuring that only authorized users can access systems and data, and validating their identities.
8. Incident Response (IR)
Establishing operational capabilities to effectively respond to security incidents and breaches.
9. Maintenance (MA)
Performing regular maintenance on information systems, ensuring that security is not compromised.
10. Media Protection (MP)
Protecting digital and non-digital media throughout its lifecycle, including during disposal.
11. Physical and Environmental Protection (PE)
Protecting physical facilities and environments that house information systems.
12. Planning (PL)
The development of security and privacy plans, aligning them with organizational processes and mission requirements.
13. Personnel Security (PS)
Ensuring that individuals with access to systems and data are trustworthy and meet established security criteria.
14. Risk Assessment (RA)
Assessing security risks to effectively manage the selection and implementation of controls.
15. System and Services Acquisition (SA)
Ensuring that information security is integrated into the system development life cycle.
16. System and Communications Protection (SC)
Protecting communications and information system boundaries, and ensuring confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
17. System and Information Integrity (SI)
Protecting information systems and information from malware, and monitoring for security anomalies.
18. Supply Chain Risk Management (SR)
Addressing risks to the supply chain and the security of the supply chain for information systems.
19. Privacy (PR)
Ensuring the confidentiality and privacy of controlled unclassified information, especially personally identifiable information (PII).
Each of these security topics forms a critical component of a comprehensive NIST 800-53 compliance program. Organizations are expected to assess their systems against these control families, implement necessary controls, and document compliance efforts and outcomes in their reporting framework. This structured approach ensures a holistic view of an organization's security posture, addressing various aspects from physical security to information integrity, and from incident response to privacy.
