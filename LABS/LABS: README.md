# LABS: READ ME FIRST

In each of the labs, you will be provided a challenge to defend ZPM International against APT32a.

There are 2 options for each of the labs:
	- Perform the actual configuration required to provide the defences.
	- Answer the questions and thus provide a documented solution to the challenge.

Unless otherwise mentioned, all answers to the questions will be available in the Microsoft Learn documentation.

An Azure Subscription is required for these labs. You can sign up for one here:

A minimal cost may be incurred when running some of the labs, so be sure to delete the lab related resources from Azure when completed the lab.
